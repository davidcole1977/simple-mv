> A basic Javascript Model View library

This is very much work in progress and not anywhere near usable yet.

### To do

* Model
	* save() and fetch() methods with associated events & callbacks
	* local storage and/or indexedDB store and fetch 'plugins'
	* collections of models
	* models / collections as datum attributes of parent model, with event bubbling
	* method chaining / fluent interface
	* arbitrary setting / getting data values at any level of model data
	* set and get data directly, without using get() / set()
	* full validation, with validate events
	* Emit custom events
	* destroy()
* View
	* subclass / extend view
	* add create() / extend() parameters / constructor options
	* method chaining / fluent interface
	* demo of data binding for simple Ractive component
	* Emit custom events
	* apply common prototype & create / extend stuff from model, collections etc.
	* change the name of the bind() method â€“ it's confusing!
* Collection
  * destroy()
* Events / pubsub
  * refactor to use a single default pubsub list instead of each model / collection etc. having its own pubsub list
  * stopListeningTo method
  * generic emitEvent (trigger) method
* Refactor common prototype methods (eg. on(), off()) into common (prototype? module?)
* Common shared extend() method
* Model saver & fetcher factories
* single entry file simple-mv.js
* Take inspiration from BackboneJS
* Write API documentation
